# PI ACE Code Migration

The Advanced Caclulation Engine for AF\EF provides the capability to execute C# and VB.Net code through runtime compilation. The engine can be used to migrate [OSIsoft PI-ACE](http://https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/PI-Server/PI-ACE/Overview/ "OSIsoft Web Site") projects to the AF system.

Due to the differences in the underlying Software Development Kits SDK's ([PI-SDK](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/Other-Products/PI-SDK/Overview "OSIsoft Web Site") vs [AF-SDK](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Documentation/PI-AF-SDK/html/1a02af4c-1bec-4804-a9ef-3c7300f5e2fc.htm "OSIsoft Web Site")) the migration is not 1:1 and therefore some changes are required.
